    title: "American Idiot",
    artist: "Green Day",
    description: "American Idiot is the seventh studio album by American rock band Green Day. Produced by Rob Cavallo, the album was released in the UK on September 20, 2004 and in the US on September 21, 2004 by Reprise Records. Green Day first achieved popularity in the 1990s with a string of successful albums. Following disappointing sales of their sixth album, Warning (2000), the band took a break before recording their next album, titled Cigarettes and Valentines. The recording process was cut short when the album's master tapes were stolen. Rather than re-record that material, the group decided to start over.",

    title: "The Dark Side of the Moon",
    artist: "Pink Floyd",
    description: "The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth album by English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records. The album built on ideas explored in earlier recordings and live shows, but lacks the extended instrumental excursions following the departure of founding member and principal contributor, Syd Barrett, in 1968, that characterised their earlier work. It thematically explores conflict, greed, the passage of time, and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by Barrett's deteriorating mental state.",

    title: "British Steel",
    artist: "Judas Priest",
    description: "British Steel saw the band reprise the commercial sound they had established on Killing Machine. This time, they abandoned some of the dark lyrical themes which had been prominent on their previous releases, but some of it still remains. In a June 2017 appearance on Sirius radio podcast \"Rolling Stone Music Now,\"[6] Rob Halford said the band may have been inspired by AC/DC on some tracks after supporting them on a European tour in 1979.[7] British Steel was recorded at Tittenhurst Park, home of former Beatle Ringo Starr, a recording studio located on Tittenhurst's grounds, after a false start at Startling Studios in December 1979.",
